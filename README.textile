h1. This is the data for my blog

It is automatically transformed by "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub.

I was tired of upgrading Wordpress, of random errors I didn't understand, of incompatibilities that made no sense, of looking through horrific PHP code. 
I finally decided to use Jekyll and GitHub to do more than just serve up the README for "beet":http://jackdempsey.github.com/beet
So, I'm forking "Tom's blog":http://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.com, removing the _posts/ and images directories as he asked, and starting fresh.

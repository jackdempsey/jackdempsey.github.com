# {{ page.title }}

I stumbled across "Try OCaml" in /r/programming the other day. I hadn't
thought much about the language in years, but remember watching an
impressive talk on it and it's usage in a speedy financial system.

As I've done with many languages, I downloaded some code, tried it out,
and fairly soon was back to my usual language, Ruby.

I've done that cycle of get interested, download, play, and fairly soon,
forget. For some reason this last glimpse at OCaml triggered this
analysis, and has me wanting to do more. 

The last language I gave a more in depth viewing to was Clojure. I've
never built anything of substance with it, but I think I'd like to, at
some point. The next roadblock is that I'm not sure how to--building
something fake with a language does nothing for you other than give you
a superficial skimming at best, and at worst a misconceived notion of
what a language really is, what it can do. 

So, I'd like to talk about several languages here that are interesting
to me and likely many others. I'll be doing a bit of research into them,
gathering some opinions and experiences, and cataloging my findings. 

The languages I'll be covering are:

* Clojure
* Haskell
* Lua
* OCaml

These are the four I find most interesting, know the least about, and
think I actually have a shot of gathering some good data on.

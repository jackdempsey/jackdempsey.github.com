I'm working on a bit of code that needs to read emails from Gmail. So far I've made use of the fetcher library:

http://github.com/look/fetcher

and have it configured to have an ActionMailer subclass receive the email for processing. 

One thing I've found useful so far, and that wasn't obvious at first, is a way to stop the emails from being marked as read. Take a look at the gist below

<script src="http://gist.github.com/479836.js"> </script>

Now, instead of going back to the account, marking the emails as unread and moving them back to the inbox, I get the info and the email stays right where it is. 

HTH

<strong>Update</strong>

In doing a bit more searching I've come across the incredibly useful ruby-gmail library: <a href="http://github.com/dcparker/ruby-gmail">http://github.com/dcparker/ruby-gmail</a> If you're doing anything with ruby and Gmail, you have to look up this plugin.
